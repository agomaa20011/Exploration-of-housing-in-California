# Coastal Dreams or Inland Realities? A Data driven exploration of housing in California

## Project background:
California’s coastline is synonymous with wealth, luxury, and a laid-back lifestyle. But does living near the ocean always mean higher home prices and wealthier residents? Are coastal areas more crowded, and do homes there age gracefully or require frequent upkeep?
This project explores how ocean proximity affects housing prices, income distribution, density, and home age helping investors, home buyers, and urban planners understand the real trade offs of coastal living.

To guide our exploration, we focus on four key questions:

### Is coastal living always expensive?
•	Where can you find the most affordable and priciest areas, and how much does an ocean view really impact home values?
### Are older homes a staple of coastal neighborhoods?
•	Do homes near the ocean tend to be older, and does age add charm or hidden maintenance costs?
### How does space compare between coastal and inland areas?
•	Is coastal living synonymous with crowded neighborhoods, or are there surprisingly spacious pockets along the shore? Where do homebuyers get the most space for their money?
### Does density impact home values over time?
•	Do homes in highly populated areas appreciate differently than those in more spacious locations? Are quieter, less crowded areas a better long-term investment?

By answering these questions with real data, this project will provide valuable insights into the realities of California’s housing market beyond the postcard-perfect coastal dream. 

This dataset includes 20,640 housing records, covering:
•	Location (Latitude & Longitude) – Where is the house?
•	Housing Median Age – How old is it?
•	Total Rooms & Bedrooms – House size matters!
•	Population & Households – How crowded is the area?
•	Median Income – What’s the average earning power?
•	Median House Value – What’s the price tag?
•	Ocean Proximity – How close is it to the coast?

## Executive summary:
Geospatial Distribution of House Prices in California 
Coastal vs. Inland Homes: Do oceanfront properties consistently command higher prices, or are there inland areas that rival them?
Income Distribution: Are wealthy individuals clustering near the beach, or do lower-income communities also exist along the coast?
Housing Density: Does coastal living mean sacrificing space and privacy?
Home Age Trends: Are older, charming homes more common by the ocean, or are coastal areas rapidly modernizing?
This project will uncover the hidden realities of living near the ocean by analyzing these aspects and providing recommendations for various stakeholders.

## Insights deep dive:
California’s housing market is a complex interplay of geography, history, and demand, with ocean proximity, housing age, population density, and affordability all shaping property values.
The Price of a View: Coastal homes are typically more expensive, with NEAR BAY and NEAR OCEAN properties commanding the highest prices. However, not all coastal regions are unaffordable certain pockets defy the price trend, offering relatively lower costs compared to high demand inland economic hubs. Meanwhile, some inland areas rival coastal prices, proving that proximity to job centers and infrastructure can drive housing values just as much as an ocean view.
